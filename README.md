# A Gentle Introduction

Welcome to the lecture materials for use in **M.Sc - Electrodynamics**
where our focus will be on the topics of:

1.  Advanced Mathematical Concepts
    - Vector Calculus
    - Separation of Variables
    - Method of Images
2.  Magnetic and Electric Materials
    - Ferromagnetism
    - Dielectric Materials
3.  Electromagnetic waves
    - Transmission and Dispersion
4.  Maxwell's Equations
    - Derivation and explanation

### Final Examination

The exam will consists of topics discussed in the lecture. You will be
given the necessary functions and definitions needed to solve the
questions and NO custom documents and/or formula sheets will be allowed.
You are allowed to bring a calculator to the exam.

The exam will take 90 mins and will focus on more numerical aspects of
electrodynamics.

## The Lecture Structure

As it currently is, the lecture covers topic from concept of
electrodynamics (i.e., camera, display) to methods to mathematcally
model them.

The structure of the lecture is shown below.

| TOPIC | DESCRIPTION | SESSION |
|----|----|----|
| Introduction | A general Introduction to the lecture | 1 |
| The Point of Electromagnetism | The historical evolution of electromagnetism and modern physics | 1 |
| Vector Calculus | Concepts of gradients, curl and divergence | 2-3 |
| Electrostatics | How charges are modelled and understanding boundary conditions | 4 |
| Advanced Mathematical Methods | Separation of variables, Method of images, … | 5 |
| Electric Properties of Materials | Polarisation, Dielectric materials | 6 |
| Magnetostatics | Understanding magnetic fields when time does not play a factor | 6 |
| Magnetic Properties of Materials | Ferromagnetism, Hysteresis curves, … | 7 |
| Electromagnetism | Electromagnetic Induction, EMF, Maxwell's Equation | 7 |
| Conservation of Energy | Defining the Poynting Vector, conservation of momentum, … | 8 |
| Electromagnetic Waves | Definition of a Wave, propagation, dispersion, | 8-9 |

## Code Supplement

The Code supplement is a Github webpage dedicated to hosting all the
relevant code used in the lecture as it is not feasible to fit all the
content of the code to the slides and it is easier to share this way.
